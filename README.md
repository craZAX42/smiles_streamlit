# smiles_streamlit
A streamlit webpage to compare two smile string 3d models.

## How It Works
We're using RDKit to generate 3D models of SMILE strings.

After you input SMILE strings to the textbox, you can compare the 2D and 3D structures side by side. There's a dropdown menu to select the style you want to render the models in. In the sidebar, you can select any two SMILE strings you've already input.
